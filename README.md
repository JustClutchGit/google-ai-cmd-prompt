# Google AI Command Prompt
This program uses a Google AI Studio API Key to communicate in CMD prompt and allows the user to chat with **LearnLM 1.5 Pro Experimental**.  This entire program was made with** Google LLMs**, and most credit goes to the LLMs, as I have slightly modified the code.

#### Models Available: 
**LearnLM 1.5 Pro Experimental**

### Future Updates:
- Model Selection
